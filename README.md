# Spec Driven (Zero Code) Clone of Tetris

This project was a challenge to create a specification driven clone of the game Teris. The rules were that is must be web-hosted and all code must be generated by an AI tool.

### Project Setup
This project was built using the following tools:
* [spec-kit](https://github.com/github/spec-kit)
* Github Copilot CLI

### Approach
The approach to this project was to use the spec-kit process of specifying an application from top to bottom. Then allowing copilot to build the application according to the spec. Spec-kit was installed into copilot for this process.

### Tech Stack
The project included only the instructions to use vite, typescript, and react. All other decisions about technology were based on the spec (including TDD) and the LLM.
